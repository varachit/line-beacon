# LINE Beacon Webhook Consumer using Express
This repository contains the rough implementation of the webhook consumer to receive beacon events form LINE.

The device (beacon) is hooked with LINE. Once LINE's users enter or are within the proximity of the beacon device. 
Eventually, the events containing those data will be delivered for every certain interval from LINE API into our webhook consumer.
