LINE Beacon Webhook Consumer using Express

This repository contains the rough implementation of the webhook consumer to receive beacon events form LINE.

The device (beacon) is hooked with LINE. Once users approach or enter the proximity of the device. Data are routinely constantly synchronized with LINE.
Finally, the events will be delivered for every certain interval from LINE API into our webhook consumer.
